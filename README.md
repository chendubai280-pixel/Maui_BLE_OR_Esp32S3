Considering that the majority of readers of this article might be ESP32 developers who are not interested in how the mobile app is developed, I will first post a ready-to-use mobile app (this app requires an Android 15 or higher system to run; there's no way around it, as Google's technology updates too rapidly). ESP32 developers can directly download and install the app, then copy the flashing code for the ESP32-S3 and flash it onto your ESP32 circuit board. You can start using it right away without needing to understand the details of app development.

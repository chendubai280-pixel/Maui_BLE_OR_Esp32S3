Considering that the majority of readers of this article might be ESP32 developers who are not interested in how the mobile app is developed, I will first post a ready-to-use mobile app (this app requires an Android 15 or higher system to run; there's no way around it, as Google's technology updates too rapidly). ESP32 developers can directly download and install the app, then copy the flashing code for the ESP32-S3 and flash it onto your ESP32 circuit board. You can start using it right away without needing to understand the details of app development.
Download and merge these three files, and you will be able to obtain the app that controls the ESP32.
